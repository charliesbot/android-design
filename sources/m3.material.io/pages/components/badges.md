#### Color

Color values are implemented through design tokens. For design, this means working with color values that correspond with tokens. For implementation, a color value will be a token that references a value. Learn more about design tokens

## Guidelines

#### Usage

Badges are used to indicate a notification, item count, or other information relating to a navigation destination. They are placed on the ending edge of icons, typically within other components.

There are two variants:
- Small badge
- Large badge

_Navigation bar with four badges_

A **small badge** is a simple circle, used to indicate an unread notification.

A **large badge** contains label text communicating item count information.

[IMAGE] A small badge is a circle with no characters.

##### With other components

Badges are most commonly used within other components, such as navigation bar, navigation rail, app bars, and tabs.

_In navigation bars, hide the badge once the destination has been selected_

#### Anatomy

[IMAGE] Small and large badges on 2 icon buttons.

_- Small badge
- Large badge container
- Large badge label_

#### Container

There are two container options for the badge:
- Small badge with no text
- Large badge with text

[IMAGE] A small badge on a navigation item.

_A small badge uses only shape to indicate a status change or new notification_

[IMAGE] Number 10 displayed within large badge on a navigation item.

_A large badge displays a number within a container to indicate a quantifiable status change related to a destination_

Badge containers are anchored inside the icon bounding box. As the number count increases for large badges, their width expands, but keeps the same placement.

Badges use a color intended to stand out against labels, icons, and navigation elements. Use the default color mapping to avoid color conflict issues.

[IMAGE DO] Small and large badges on the left side of 2 navigation items in a right-to-left language.

**DO:** _Change the position of the badge for right-to-left languages_

[IMAGE DON'T] Small and large badges at random positions on 3 icon buttons on a navigation rail.

**DON'T:** _Badges have fixed positions. Don’t change the position of the badge arbitrarily or place the badge over the icon._

[IMAGE DO] Small and large badges in default red color on 3 navigation items.

**DO:** _Use the default badge color_

[IMAGE DON'T] Small and large badges in custom colors on 3 navigation items.

**DON'T:** _Avoid using custom color roles for the badge container and label text. If custom roles are necessary, make sure they have contrast of at least 3:1._

##### Label text

Label large badges with counts or a status. The maximum number of characters within large badge label text is four, including a + to indicate more.

[IMAGE] 4 icons with increasing number badges. The badges represent quantities, using a "+" symbol for quantities over 999.

_Large badges with one to four characters_

Use the recommended maximum character count to ensure labels don’t extend beyond the badge container.

[IMAGE DO] 4-digit numbers condensed to a 3-digit badge with "+" to fit the badge container's width.

**DO:** _Truncate badge labels as needed_

[IMAGE DON'T] 4-digit and 5-digit number badges on navigation items exceed the badge container's width and get cut off at the edge.

**DON'T:** _Don’t let the badge get cut off or collide with another element_

#### Placement

[IMAGE DO] Large badge to the right of a navigation rail item.

**DO:** _Use a large badge to show count information when visual collisions aren’t an issue, such as in a navigation rail_

[IMAGE CAUTION] Small badge on an icon button in an app bar.

**CAUTION:** _Use a small badge when spaces are tightly constrained, such as app bars. Small badges won’t run into the edge of the screen._

[IMAGE DO] Large badge placed at the end of a tab.

**DO:** _When an icon with a badge is followed by text or another element, place a large badge at the trailing edge_

[IMAGE DON'T] Large badge overlapping the icon and text in a tab.

**DON'T:** _Avoid using a large badge when it might overlap with a trailing element. Either place it at the trailing edge or use a small badge instead._

## Accessibility

#### Use cases

People should be able to use assistive technology to:
- Understand the dynamic information conveyed in badges, such as counts or labels
- Address badge announcements by selecting corresponding navigation destinations

#### Interaction & style

Badges are most commonly used within other components, such as navigation bar, navigation rail, app bars, and tabs.

When a badge is used to indicate an unread notification, the badge gets hidden once it's selected.

#### Visual indicators

Badges use a color intended to stand out against labels, icons, and navigation elements. Use the default color mapping to avoid color conflict issues.

[IMAGE DO] Diagram of large and small badges showing that they need to pass 3 to 1 contrast.

**DO:** _Badges must use default color with at least 3:1 contrast_

[IMAGE DON'T] Diagram of large and small badges not passing 3 to 1 contrast.

**DON'T:** _Avoid using custom color roles for the badge container and label text. If custom roles are necessary, make sure they have contrast of at least 3:1._

#### Labeling elements

The accessibility label for a badge item will be read after its navigation destination. Any numerical badges will have their number read, while non-counting badges will simply announce **New notification**.
